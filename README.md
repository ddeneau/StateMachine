# StateMachine
This is a pretty simple c++ project just to try templates.
It could be used as a starting point to implement state-based structures or algorithms in C++.
For example, I wrote the transisition function to take in a string (a decimal number) and convert it, then reverse it (to obtain the binary representation of the same number).
